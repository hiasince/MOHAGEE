Application
The Mohagee application is a customized scheduling application that recommends the right place to the user based on his / her desired schedule, theme (time, place, location, and sub-category * sub category). It is the goal of the application to ensure that users do not worry much about future schedules.
First, data is collected based on Gangnam Station.

## Detail of feature
### Basic login & subscription features
main screen
Implemented the screen of Instagram. Because of the performance of a server, the quality of images is poor.
It shows the data at the top of the cafe and restaurant at random in the order of the highest rating of the data that the server has. We will provide the name, address, star and photos of each place.

### Search route
You can get a recommendation by choosing the time, location, the person who you play with, and the major and minor categories.

### View by category
You can see the list of major and minor categories by region. You can see the details of each place by selecting a place for each category. If you only want to set up a location and do not have a place you want to go to, you can use the view by category.

### Custom path
The custom path is the ability to selectively create a route to the desired locations by selecting the list you have added.
If you see the place detail screen, there is a heart button, and when you press that button, the place is added to the custom list.
Select the desired places and press the Create Path button to apply the location and route to the map as you would search for the recommended route.
